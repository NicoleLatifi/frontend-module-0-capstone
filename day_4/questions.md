## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?

A function organizes a specific command or a group of commands so that you can later call that function whenever needed.

1. What is a parameter?

A parameter is a piece of information needed in a function. It is a value that will be inputted into the function.

1. What is a return value?

The return value is the response of the function once it is called.

1. In the space below, create a function named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```JavaScript
function hello() {
  var helloMessage = "Sam I am";
  console.log(helloMessage);
}

hello();
```

1. Create a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.
```JAVASCRIPT
function hello_somone() {
  var name = ;
  console.log(name + " I am");
}
```

1. How would you call or execute the function that you created above?
```JavaScript
hello_someone();
```

1. What questions do you still have about functions in Javascript?

There are a few different ways to write a function, i.e. with the variable can be inside or outside of the function. And I'm wondering if one way is the conventional method or better in some way.
